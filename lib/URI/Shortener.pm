=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Actually shortening the URIs
    my $s = URI::Shortener->new(
        domain => 'ACGT',
        prefix => 'https://go.mydomain.test/short',
        dbname => '/opt/myApp/uris.db',
        seed   => 90210,
        length => 12,
    );
    my $uri = 'https://mydomain.test/somePath';
    # Persistently memoizes via sqlite
    my $short = $s->shorten( $uri );
    # Short will look like 'https://go.mydomain.test/short/szAgqIE
    ...
    # Presumption here is that your request router knows what to do with this, e.g. issue a 302:
    my $long = $s->lengthen( $short );
    ...
    # Prune old URIs
    $s->prune_before(time());

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides utility methods so that you can:

1) Create a new short uri and store it for usage later
2) Persistently pull it up
3) Store a creation time so you can prune the database later.

We use sqlite for persistence.

=head2 ALGORITHM

The particular algorithm used to generate the ciphertext composing the shortened URI is Crypt::PRNG's 'fortuna'.
This is used to make it very difficult to guess valid shortened URIs.

The seed used is the one passed to the constructor plus the database row ID.
As there is no guarantee of uniform distribution, such as in a Mersenne Twister, sometimes this will fail.
Even were we using such, nobody ever implements nth-guess, which means we have to slog through actual generation which is worse performing than miss/retry in practice.

In such events, we simply burn the ID (leaving it as a dead record) and move on until we succeed.
This is implemented by goto &shorten, which means in the event you run out of possible URIs, you will smash the stack or fill your disk (whichever comes first).

As such we die after failing 64 times to prevent such outcomes.
This is also why a pruning method for old records has been provided.

=head2 IMPORTANT

It must be stressed that choosing a sufficiently large domain and length is important.
Sane defaults are used, but if you choose something lesser, you will have to prune aggressively to prevent bad outcomes.
You are basically "locked in" to your choice of domain/length/seed once you put something based upon this into production.

The difficulty of bruting for valid URIs scales with the size of the domain and length.

You shouldn't store particularly sensitive information in any URI, or attempt to use this as a means of access control.
It only takes one right guess to ruin someone's day.

I strongly recommend that you configure whatever serves these URIs be behind a fail2ban rule that bans 3 or more 4xx responses.

The domain & seed used is not stored in the DB, so don't lose it.
You can't use a DB valid for any other domain/seed and expect anything but GIGO.

Multiple different prefixes for the shortened URIs are OK though.
The more you use, the harder it is to guess valid URIs.
Sometimes, CNAMEs are good for something.

=head2 OTHER CONSEQUENCES

If you prune old DB records and your database engine will then reuse these IDs, be aware that this will result in some old short URIs resolving to new pages.

=head2 UTF-8

I have not tested this module with a UTF8 domain.
My expectation is that it will not work at all with it, but this could be patched straighforwardly.

=cut

our $SCHEMA = qq{
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS uris (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    prefix_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES prefix(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    uri TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    cipher TEXT DEFAULT NULL UNIQUE,
    created INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS prefix (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    prefix TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS uri_idx     ON uris(uri);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS prefix_idx  ON prefix(prefix);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS cipher_idx  ON uris(cipher);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS created_idx ON uris(created);
};

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 $class->new(%options)

See SYNOPSIS for supported optiosn.

We strip trailing slash(es) from the prefix.

The 'dbfile' you pass will be created automatically for you if possible.
Otherwise we will croak the first time you run shorten() or lengthen().

length controls the length of the minified path component.
Defaulted to 12 when not a member of the natural numbers.

domain is by default a..zA..Z as a string.

This is obviously an n Choose k situation, which means the default number of URIs possible is:

558,383,307,300

Which I should hope is more than enough for most use cases.

=cut

sub new {
    my ( $class, %options ) = @_;
    $options{domain} ||= join('',('a'..'z','A'..'Z'));

    foreach my $required (qw{domain prefix dbname seed}) {
        die "$required required" unless $options{$required};
    }
    $options{length} = 12 if !$options{length} || $options{length} < 0;

    # Strip trailing slash from prefix
    $options{prefix} =~ s|/+$||;
    return bless( \%options, $class );
}

=head1 METHODS

=head2 cipher( INTEGER $id )

Wrapper around Crypt::PRNG::string_from().

Uses the passed seed + id as the seed, and builds string_from via the domain passed to the constructor.

=cut

sub cipher {
    my ( $self, $id ) = @_;
    my $rr = Crypt::PRNG->new('Fortuna', $self->{seed} + $id);
    return $rr->string_from($self->{domain}, $self->{length});
}

=head2 shorten($uri)

Transform original URI into a shortened one.

=cut

# Like with any substitution cipher, reversal is trivial when the domain is known.
# But, if we have to fetch the URI anyways, we may as well just store the cipher for reversal (aka the "god algorithm").
# This allows us the useful feature of being able to use many URI prefixes.
my $smash=0;
sub shorten {
    my ( $self, $uri ) = @_;

    my $query = "SELECT id, cipher FROM uris WHERE uri=?";

    my $rows = $self->_dbh()->selectall_arrayref( $query, { Slice => {} }, $uri );
    $rows //= [];

        return $self->{prefix}."/".$rows->[0]{cipher} if $rows->[0]{cipher};
        my $ciphered = $self->cipher( $rows->[0]{id} );
        my $worked = $self->_dbh()->do( "UPDATE uris SET cipher=? WHERE id=?", undef, $ciphered, $rows->[0]{id} );
        # In the (incredibly rare) event of a collision, just burn the row and move on.
        if (!$worked) {
            warn "DANGER: cipher collision detected.";
            $self->_dbh()->do( "UPDATE uris SET uri=? WHERE id=?", undef, "$uri-BURNED$smash", $rows->[0]{id} ) or die "Could not burn row";
            $smash++;
            die "Too many failures to avoid name collisions encountered, prune your DB!" if $smash > 64;
            goto \&shorten;
        }
        return $self->{prefix} . "/" . $ciphered;
    }

    # Otherwise we need to store the URI and retrieve the ID.
    my $pis        = "SELECT id FROM prefix WHERE prefix=?";

    $self->_dbh()->do( $qq, undef, $uri, time(), $self->{prefix} ) or die $self->dbh()->errstr;
    goto \&shorten;
}

=head2 lengthen($uri)

Transform shortened URI into it's original.

=cut

sub lengthen {
    my ( $self, $uri ) = @_;
    my ($cipher) = $uri =~ m|^\Q$self->{prefix}\E/(.*)$|;

    my $query = "SELECT uri FROM uris WHERE cipher=? AND prefix_id IN (SELECT id FROM prefix WHERE prefix=?)";

    my $rows = $self->_dbh()->selectall_arrayref( $query, { Slice => {} }, $cipher, $self->{prefix} );
    $rows //= [];
    return unless @$rows;
    return $rows->[0]{uri};
}

=head2 prune_before(TIME_T $when)

Remove entries older than UNIX timestamp $when.

=cut

sub prune_before {
    my ( $self, $when ) = @_;
    $self->_dbh()->do( "DELETE FROM uris WHERE created < ?", undef, $when ) or die $self->dbh()->errstr;
    return 1;
}

my $dbh = {};

sub _dbh {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my $dbname = $self->{dbname};
    return $dbh->{$dbname} if exists $dbh->{$dbname};

    # Some systems splash down without this.  YMMV.
    File::Touch::touch($dbname) if $dbname ne ':memory:' && !-f $dbname;

    my $db = DBI->connect( "dbi:SQLite:dbname=$dbname", "", "" );

    $db->{sqlite_allow_multiple_statements} = 0;
