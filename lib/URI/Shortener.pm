=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Actually shortening the URIs
    my $s = URI::Shortener->new(
        domain => 'ACGT',
        prefix => 'https://go.mydomain.test/short',
        dbname => '/opt/myApp/uris.db',
        seed   => 90210,
        length => 12,
    );
    my $uri = 'https://mydomain.test/somePath';
    # Persistently memoizes via sqlite
    my $short = $s->shorten( $uri );
    # Short will look like 'https://go.mydomain.test/short/szAgqIE
    ...
    # Presumption here is that your request router knows what to do with this, e.g. issue a 302:
    my $long = $s->lengthen( $short );
    ...
    # Prune old URIs
    $s->prune_before(time());

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides utility methods so that you can:

1) Create a new short uri and store it for usage later

2) Persistently pull it up

3) Store a creation time so you can prune the database later.

We use sqlite for persistence by default with WALmode on, so it should be safe to use in a preforking multiple worker situation.

Alternatively, you can choose to use postgres or mysql.

=head2 WHY?

URI shorteners are typically used for media requiring fixed-width content, such as text email.
Email in particular benefits when you have intermediate servers that alter complex URIs in bodies to "protect" their users.
This tends to make DKIM signed messages fail for predictable reasons.

They are also useful for being easy to say in phonetic alphabets.

On the other hand, they're also an unavoidable mechanism to implement user tracking, such as is commonly done by social networking applications.
Similarly, they are the backbone of many phishing spam campaigns.

You could also use this to build a site (or make portions of it) resistant to indexing due to random URIs.
This is common practice for "unlisted" posts sent by mailing lists which want some degree of exclusivity without resorting fully to a paywall.

=head2 ALGORITHM

The particular algorithm used to generate the ciphertext composing the shortened URI is Crypt::PRNG's 'fortuna'.
This is used to make it very difficult to guess valid shortened URIs.

The seed used is the one passed to the constructor plus the database row ID.
As there is no guarantee of uniform distribution, such as in a Mersenne Twister, sometimes this will fail.
Even were we using such, nobody ever implements nth-guess, which means we have to slog through actual generation which is worse performing than miss/retry in practice.

In such events, we simply burn the ID (leaving it as a dead record) and move on until we succeed.
This is implemented by goto &shorten, which means in the event you run out of possible URIs, you will smash the stack or fill your disk (whichever comes first).

As such we die after failing 64 times to prevent such outcomes.
This is also why a pruning method for old records has been provided.

=head2 IMPORTANT

It must be stressed that choosing a sufficiently large domain and length is important.
Sane defaults are used, but if you choose something lesser, you will have to prune aggressively to prevent bad outcomes.
You are basically "locked in" to your choice of domain/length/seed once you put something based upon this into production.

The difficulty of bruting for valid URIs scales with the size of the domain and length.

You shouldn't store particularly sensitive information in any URI, or attempt to use this as a means of access control.
It only takes one right guess to ruin someone's day.

I strongly recommend that you configure whatever serves these URIs be behind a fail2ban rule that bans 3 or more 4xx responses.

The domain & seed used is not stored in the DB, so don't lose it.
You can't use a DB valid for any other domain/seed and expect anything but GIGO.

Multiple different prefixes for the shortened URIs are OK though.
The more you use, the harder it is to guess valid URIs.
Sometimes, CNAMEs are good for something.

=head2 OTHER CONSEQUENCES

If you prune old DB records and your database engine will then reuse these IDs, be aware that this will result in some old short URIs resolving to new pages.

=head2 UTF-8

I have not tested this module with a UTF8 domain.
My expectation is that it will not work at all with it, but this could be patched straighforwardly.

=head2 OTHER DATABASES

We support use of other databases than sqlite, should you so desire.
Set the dbhost, dbport, dbuser, dbpass and specify an appropriate dbtype (supported: sqlite, pg, mysql).

While we choose to use the largest possible autoincrementing primary key type,
be aware you will be fundamentally limited to the largest integer that can represent.
Mysql's BIGINT in particular is different than Postgres' BIGSERIAL and SQLite's INTEGER.

If the names of the tables/indexes collides with stuff already in your DB, you can pass parameters to the constructor to fix that.
Here are the defaults:

	uri_tablename    => 'uris',
	prefix_tablename => 'prefix',
	uri_idxname      => 'uri_idx',
	prefix_idxname   => 'prefix_idx',
	cipher_idxname   => 'cipher_idx',
    created_idxname  => 'created_idx',

Be aware that this is done via regexp replacement, so if you have too similar of names, bad things will occur.

=head2 MYSQL LIMITATIONS

Due to the nature of mysql's text handling, we don't make the 'uri' or 'prefix' fields in their respective tables unique.
Similarly, the cipher (domain) length is limited to 180 chars, as this is about as big as you can prudently use on utf8mb4.

We also are not creating any indices whatsoever.
Pull requests welcome.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 $class->new(%options)

=over 4

=item C<dbname>

Name of the database to use.  Filename when using sqlite.

=item C<dbtype>

Type of database to use.  Supported: (sqlite, mysql, pg)

=item C<dbhost,dbport,dbuser,dbpass>

Means to connect to remote databases, such as is the case with mysql/pg

dbhost defaults to localhost, and dbport defaults to the relevant default port.
Otherwise the relevant ENV vars are obeyed when no options are passed.

See _my_dbh() and _pg_dbh() for the particulars.

Also, mysql will obey the mysql_read_default_file/group parameters, and defaults to using ~/.my.cnf and the 'client' group.

=item C<prefix>

URI prefix of shortened output.  Trailing slashes will be stripped.  Example: https://big.hugs/go/

=item C<length>

Length of the minified path component. Defaulted to 12 when not a member of the natural numbers.

=item C<domain>

Input domain string. Shortened path components are a char within this string. By default a..zA..Z.

=item C<seed>

Starting seed of the PRNG.

=back

This is obviously an "N Choose K" situation (n possible chars from 'domain' in 'length' slots).
The default number of URIs possible is:

    558,383,307,300

Which I should hope is more than enough for most use cases.
